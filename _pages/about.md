Hi! I am Sven, a second-year M.Sc. student in Economics at the <a href='https://www.econ.uni-bonn.de/en?set_language=en'>University of Bonn</a>. In addition, I work as a research assistant at the <a href='https://www.macrohistory.net'>MacroFinance & MacroHistory Lab</a>.

My main interests are macroeconomics, heterogenous agents, monetary policy, and programming. I am a big proponent of reproducibility and the open-source philosophy.

Check out my <a href='https://github.com/SvenEis'>GitHub</a> to have a look at my projects.
