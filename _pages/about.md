Hi! My name is Sven, and I am an M.Sc. Economics student at the <a href='https://www.econ.uni-bonn.de/en?set_language=en'>University of Bonn</a>. In addition, I work as a research assistant at the <a href='https://www.macrohistory.net'>MacroFinance & MacroHistory Lab</a>.

My main interests are macroeconomics, heterogenous agents, inequality, and monetary policy.
